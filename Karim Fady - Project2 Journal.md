Karim Fady - Project Journal

Project Duration: May 13 â€“ May 20, 10:00PM

May 13, 2:00PM: Collaborated on initial design and architecture planning for the Tomasulo simulator.

May 14, 4:00PM: Created the reservation_station structure and linked it to instruction issue logic.

May 15, 2:30PM: Implemented the functional unit latency handler via getLatency().

May 16, 11:00AM: Worked on the register renaming mechanism using Qj/Qk status tagging.

May 17, 5:00PM: Assisted with debugging infinite loop issue when BEQ was taken and instructions were skipped.

May 17, 12:30PM: Improved instruction execution tracking for write-back and statistical reporting.

May 18, 3:00PM: Verified CALL and RET jumps and made sure PC logic updated correctly.

May 19, 10:00AM: Ran full tests and checked IPC and misprediction metrics across scenarios.

May 19, 5:30PM: Helped implement fixes to terminate simulation based on issued instruction count.

May 20, 11:00AM: Reviewed README and report content for clarity and completeness.
