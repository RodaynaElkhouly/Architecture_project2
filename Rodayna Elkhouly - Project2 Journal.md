Project Duration: May 13 – May 20, 10:00PM

May 13, 2:00PM: Set up the initial project structure and defined basic classes for simulator components.

May 14, 3:30PM: Implemented the instruction parsing and loading logic from .txt files.

May 15, 12:00PM: Added support for arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB) in the simulator backend.

May 16, 6:00PM: Integrated LOAD and STORE execution logic with memory access functions.

May 17, 10:00AM: Fixed bugs in write-back stage, especially for RAW hazard broadcasting.

May 17, 1:30PM: Debugged BEQ instruction behavior — ensured correct PC redirection when branch is taken.

May 18, 4:00PM: Added CALL and RET implementation, confirmed return logic via test cases.

May 18, 11:00AM: Helped set up the test harness to run and validate multiple assembly programs.

May 19, 2:00PM: Wrote and validated test case with two BEQ instructions to measure misprediction rate.

May 20, 9:30AM: Finalized report and validated correctness of simulation outputs.
